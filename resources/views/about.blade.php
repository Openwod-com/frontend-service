<h4 class="mt-3"><b>About OpenWOD</b></h4>
<p>
    <b>OpenWOD</b> (Open Workout Of the Day) is a free online booking system for training activities.
</p>
<p>
    <b>OpenWOD</b> was created by Rasmus and Mathias Sundman who has been arranging free Function Fitness (Crossfit-style)
    outdoor classes in Sweden for several years and needed a booking system to manage the classes.
</p>
<p> <b>OpenWOD</b> is now released to the public to inspire other people to come together and train together.
    Feel free to join, create your "gym" and invite your friends to come workout with you!
</p>
<h5><b>Commersial Use</b></h5>
<p>
    Feel free to use the system even if you run a commersial bussiness and just need a simple booking system
    to manage your classes.
